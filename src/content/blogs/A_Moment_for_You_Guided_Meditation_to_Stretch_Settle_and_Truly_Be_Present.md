# Stop Existing and Start Living: Your 10-minute, No-fail Guide to Experiencing the Gift of Life.
Do you get the feeling that you are living on autopilot? So fast we move, with deadlines to meet and schedules to keep, and all-day and all-night digital assaults that we have sometimes completely forgotten the basic miracle of being bodily right where we are. The anxiety of the future and the burden of the past are able to submerge the beauty of this same moment.

The answer is not so difficult. It involves stopping, breathing and listening. The above audio **Feeling the Gift of Life Guided Meditation** is meant to assist you in leaving your busy mind and falling into the silent, vibrant fact of your physical self within 10 minutes of listening to this audio player.

## Why This Meditation Works: The Power of Body-Centric Presence
This specific guided meditation will help you forget all about what is happening in the external environment and focus on the internal world, specifically on the heart center and the beat of your breath. It is not just some fluffy self-help but is heavily supported by highly powerful physiological principles.
### Focused Benefits:
*   **Parasympathetic Activation:** You can use the vagus nerve by focusing your thoughts on the act of breathing, that is, the conscious expansion and contraction of your diaphragm. It is the primary pathway to your parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), which is the “rest and digest” side of your body.
*   **Heart Coherence:** The practice focuses the energy in the center of your heart. The studies in mind-body wellness prove that gratitude and appreciation (which is the main message of this meditation) promote variability in heart rate (HRV), which predisposes emotional stability and resilience.
*   **Releasing Mental Clutter:** The guide helps you to watch and discharge thoughts of the future or the past. You can practice this by bringing your conscious mind back to the here and now, the sensation of your heart beating, of the air going through you, and you will essentially be training your mind to quit worrying and start experiencing.
The practice brings you down to earth by making you so conscious of your existence. It is such a potent reminder of the fact that "Your body truly is a miracle, and being alive is a miracle."

## When to Tap Into the Gift of Life
The meditation is mobile and does not require knowing where you are. It focuses on awareness of the body and breath, making it efficient regardless of whether you are sitting still or engaging in mild movement.
The following are the three best moments to put on the audio above:
### 1. The Midday Reset
When you feel a drop at 2 PM, have too many things on your list, or see your shoulders are becoming tighter, then use this session. It provides a quick, fresh escape from work pressure and grounds you to get back to what you were doing, feeling refreshed with life force energy.
### 2. During Gentle Movement
Contrary to most guided meditations, where the perfect stillness is expected, this audio is specifically supportive of motion. Combine it with a slow move, a nighttime yoga session, or even with minimal movement, such as standing and rocking. Allow the words you are guided by to intensify your admiration for the ability of your body.
### 3. Before Major Transitions
Do it before an important event, meeting or difficulty. Listening to the confidence of your heart beating, to the evenness of your breath, is a very strong inner anchor, a way of opening to the greatest depth of calmness, no matter what is going on outside.

## Getting the Most Out of This Session
These steps are easy to prepare for; however, by adhering to these simple tips, you are bound to experience the full extent of presence and gratitude.
### Find Your Comfort
The greatest principle is to trust your body. Now, find a position that seems innately good to you. This could be:
*   Perching yourself in a chair, keeping your feet straight on the ground.
*   Resting comfortably, and probably with a pillow beneath your knees.
*   Doing some mild stretching or some yoga.
### Listen Deeply
You can use the headphones, which we suggest. This assists in eliminating the ambient noise and is a full immersion into the relaxing instructions so that you can quite clearly hear the instructions to focus on the centre of your heart and diaphragmatic breath.
### Eyes Open or Closed?
You are at liberty to select what assists in your concentration:
*   **Eyes Closed:** This is the best to do when one would like to develop the interior awareness and minimize the distraction of the vision.
*   **Eyes Open (Soft Gaze):** This is helpful when closing the eyes causes you to be sleepy, or with the use of gentle movement. Just let your gaze rest softly on one point without intense focus.
