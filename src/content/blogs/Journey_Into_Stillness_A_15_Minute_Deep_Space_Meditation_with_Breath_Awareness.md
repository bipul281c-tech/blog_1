# The Day Sarah Discovered Space Inside Her

Sarah sank into her desk, her shoulders almost to her ears. Her jaw was so tight that it was aching. The emails continued to flood, her task list appeared to be interminable, and she was as pressure-cooked as she could be.

Sound familiar?

This was Sarah at 2 PM on a random Tuesday. She was heavy, as the concrete made her. Every breath felt shallow. Stress and worry were crammed into her entire body.

## What Changed Everything? 

It was at that time that her friend forwarded her a mere audio meditation. Just 15 minutes long. The message said: "Try this. It made me think that I was able to breathe once again.

Sarah was skeptical. She had previously attempted meditation and tends to simply write mental lists of groceries. But she was desperate. And so she took her headphones and sat somewhere in silence and pressed play.

## What This Meditation Actually Does

The thing about this meditation is that it is not one of those breathing-in-breathing-out exercises.

Instead, it helps you remember something wild: your body is mostly empty space.

Sounds strange, right? But scientists say it's true. Your body atoms are mostly space in between minute particles. You're not as solid as you feel.

This meditation helps you actually experience that spaciousness. To cease being a narrowly closed box and become more like the open sky.

## Why It Works

You start gripping your muscles without even knowing when you are stressed. Your breathing gets shallow. Your entire system enters the danger mode.

This 15-minute practice turns this switch:

It involves deep, strong breaths in order to make your nervous system know that you are safe.
It makes you concentrate on the feelings rather than on mental images.
It reminds your body to relax as it is linked to the openness that you have in nature.

Relaxing is not something you are enforcing. You are just remembering what a rest would be like.

## Sarah's Experience

By the end of the 15 minutes Sarah spent, something was different. Her shoulders had dropped. Her mouth was no longer tight. She no longer felt like that block of concrete.

The emails were still there. The to-do list hadn't shrunk. But she felt different. Lighter. As she had space to move and breathe within her life.

## When to Use This

You do not need to wait till there is a crisis. The following are three ideal moments to do so:

* **Mid-day meltdown?** When you reach your afternoon wall, and your brain is full of electricity, use 15 minutes. You will go back with a clear head and a clear face.

* **Can't sleep?** This type of meditation is a way of letting go of all the tension you have been bearing before bed. It will be greatly appreciated by your body, and you will sleep more easily.

* **Creative or big meeting in the future?** Pre-read this in order to dispel mental clutter. You will appear centered and composed, able to think objectively.

## How to Get the Most from It

Keep it simple:

* **Get comfortable.** Whatever is good, sit, lie down--15 minutes.
* **Use headphones.** You will hear the low commentary, it is.
* **Don't overthink it.** This is not what it takes to do it right. Just feel what you feel
* **Start with deep breaths.** This will be done by the guide.

## The Big Idea

You are not simply a hard, tense person who is marching in life.

You're spacious. You're open. You can breathe in you--you can feel in you--you can be in you.

It is a meditation on that truth to you. Your 15 minutes of leave to release the knot of clenching and begin the process of expansion.

You can consider it in the following way: the stress is in the form of clouds moving through the sky. But you? You're the sky itself. Vast. Open. Indifferent to the flow of things.

## Ready to Feel Different?

This meditation is something Sarah has resorted to doing every time life begins to tighten around her. Some weeks that's daily. Some weeks it's just once. But she has always returned to it at the times when she must remember: she is not concrete. She's made of space.

Your turn. Grab your headphones. Find 15 minutes. Press play.
Let yourself become like space.
