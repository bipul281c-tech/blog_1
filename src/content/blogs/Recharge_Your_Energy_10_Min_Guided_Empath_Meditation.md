# Stop Feeling Drained: A 10-Minute Energy Reset for Sensitive People

Have you ever been exhausted when you were around people? As though you have adopted the stress, the anxiety or the bad mood of everyone?

You're not imagining it. And you're definitely not "too sensitive."

When you are an empath or are very sensitive, you will have a different perception of the world. You feel the energies, the emotions not even felt by other people. It is, in fact, an extraordinary gift--but it can make you feel so tired and overpowering, and so lost in a haze of feeling that you hardly know which of your own or anybody's is your own.

The good news? You are able to learn how to conserve your energy without isolating yourself in the world.

At the top of this page, there is a 10-minute guided meditation that is called Meditation for the Empathetic Soul. It is actually made just for our type of people. You just have to scroll up and press play when you are ready.

## Why You Feel So Drained (And What Actually Helps)

The thing that occurs is as follows: Your system will be constantly scanning your surroundings and collecting signals around everyone there. It is their stress that becomes your stress. Their sadness weighs on you. The disorderedness in them is your disorderedness.

The reason that this meditation is effective is that it teaches you something simple but powerful, which is that you are the observer, not the absorber.

You are taught not to absorb the energy of everyone, but rather to make space. You create an internal anchor, a cool, focused space inside yourself, which remains constant regardless of what is going on in the outer world.

### What Happens in Your Body

It is not a mere relaxation practice when you do this meditation. You are, in fact, stimulating the calm-down mechanism of the nervous system.

Here's what that does for you:

You no longer react automatically - You do not take up the feelings of other people at once, and you get to know how to sense them without emulating them.

You are less airy - By paying attention to your breath and body, you can be in touch with yourself, and this, by default, protects you against energy wasting.

You are more at home in your own skin - Even basic statements such as I am here, I am safe, I am me, recondition your brain to accept that you are okay, even under the circumstances that may seem extreme.

## When to Use Your 10-Minute Reset

The best part? You do not have to spend an hour on equipment. Ten minutes will change your energy totally.

### Try it when:

You drag the afternoon in. You feel like you have sucked the stress of everybody you have been in contact with? This resets your system

Before or after being with people - You can use it before a family dinner to put your limits, or after a tiring conversation to get their energy out of the system.

Early in the morning - It is best to start your day with yourself and not be at the mercy of the moods of others at a glance.

Whenever you feel bad, not sure why you are heavy or tense? This assists you in isolating your emotions from what you have inherited from others.

## How to Get the Most from This Practice

You do not have to be a meditation expert. It is just a matter of getting comfortable and letting the guidance do the talking.

### Quick Setup Tips:

* Warm up - Get a blanket, sit down in your favorite chair, or lie down on the bed. This is not meditation; it is a question of being in a secure position.

* Wear headphones (where possible) - It will allow you to listen to the guidance without having to pay attention to the distractions.

* Sit or lie down - Whatever you want. You need to simply feel supported.

* Shut your eyes - Banish for a few minutes the outside world. Focus on your breath. Whenever the thoughts arise, it is absolutely normal to simply observe them and allow them to pass.

And you are not attempting to empty your mind. You are just training to go home to yourself.

## Your Energy Matters Too

Empathy implies that you are concerned about other people. You are emotional, people like you and most likely put the needs of others first before your own.

But this is the fact: you cannot empty the cup that is dry.

It does not take ten minutes to get yourself down to earth. It's essential. When you are in touch with your energy, you are, in fact, in a better position to be fully present with the people you love, without losing yourself in the process.

You should feel good, refreshed and yourself.
