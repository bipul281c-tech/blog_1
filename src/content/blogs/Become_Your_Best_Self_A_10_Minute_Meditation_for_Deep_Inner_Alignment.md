# Becoming Your Best Self: A 10-Minute Guide to Aligning with Your Highest Potential

Do you ever feel like your "best self" is just around the corner—always slightly out of reach?

We are in a world where success is always determined by results, prizes and titles. This puts such a strain that it burns out, gives you anxiety, and the sense of not being good yet. However, what was supposed to happen when you decide to become your best version of yourself is not to do more but to actually become who you are, now.

This potent 10 Minute Guided Meditation is your starting point in case you are willing to change the focus to the desire to become a *triumphant presence.* **The audio player embedded right above this text is designed to help you tap into the essence of your perfect, capable self, right now.**

Press play when you are ready to stop chasing potential and start living it.

## The Transformative Effect of This 10-Minute Practice

It is not only about easy relaxation but actual internal restructuring. The mediated practice addresses two fundamental principles of psychology to help your mind out of the state of stress to a broad clarity.

### The Power of Continuous Breath

The session starts by leading you into a flow of breathing whereby you are aware of the softening and contracting of the body.

This deep breathing is specifically done with the intention of instantly triggering your parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). This is the rest and digest mode of your body, which literally gets down the stress hormone cortisol and removes the mental fog around that can be preventing clarity and confidence.

### Visualizing Your Highest Timeline

The essence of this meditation is achieved through great visualization. You are asked to become aware of the great possibilities surrounding you, namely comparing the schedule of you not taking care of yourself, with the schedule of **you give your best love to yourself.** 

The process of envisioning this ideal self with vividness is what you are utilizing the plasticity of the brain for. It forms deep neural networks that relate to self-esteem and self-actualization, which makes you a lot more likely to find yourself in the history you wish to be a part of. The ideal self is just the self that has used all the real potential in you.

## When to Use This Practice

Consider the scenario: You have a big deadline, and it is 3 PM, and the self-doubt is beginning to creep up. You experience the stress of “being better” or “working harder.” This is where you have to stop striving and get into your strength.

It is an ideal 10-minute session that will help you quickly develop an anchoring in self-appreciation and possibility so that you won’t need outside confirmation.

**Try integrating this audio when you need a quick shift in perspective:**

*   **Before a Major Decision:** Make use of it in order to offload the extraneous demands and be on a time scale that is honestly in your best interest.
*   **When Feeling Imposter Syndrome:** The idea here is centered around valuing the perfect you that you already are, and the removal of titles and labels in an attempt to reinstate your innate self-worth.
*   **As a Mid-Day Reset:** When you suffer a case of scattered thinking, this meditation will bring you back to the present moment in your body so that you can go back to work with your head in the right place.

## Getting the Most Out of This Session

To be able to be wholly involved in the visualization and breath work, it is necessary to be properly set up. The guide will explain all the details, but here are three important tips to keep in mind during preparation before pressing the play button:

### 3 Steps to Optimal Meditation

1.  **Find Your Foundation:** Sit in a comfortable posture, making sure that you are alert but relaxed. Help your spine to be straight, tall, with your shoulders rolled back a little. This pose makes one alert and helps in breathing easily.
2.  **Use Headphones (Recommended):** It is best to listen to the relaxing directions and background music with full immersion. Headphones will not distract your ears, and they will significantly improve the level of focus and visualization.
3.  **Open to Receive:** It is recommended that you position your palms in your lap and face up. This little yet token gesture informs your body that you are ready to be open to the possibility, love, and awareness of the universe.

## Conclusion: The Best Self Is Already You

You do not need to wait until external factors allow you to give yourself the go-ahead to be the best that you can be. That is the version of you, the one that is running on pure essence, nothing weighed down by titles and labels--you already have the version of you that runs on pure essence.

This is a ride to consciously decide on the best timeline to live in of your life by enjoying the incredible, worthy person that you have become. The more you can reach into that true self of yours, the easier your journey.
