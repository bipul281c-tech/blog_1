# Stop Scrolling: Your Moment of Peace is Waiting

## The Power of Presence: Why Gratitude Is Your Superpower

Appreciation is not a puff, but it is an essential neurological recharge. This guided meditation relies on basic relaxation methods to physically and mentally kick-start out of the fight or flight mode.

The activation of the parasympathetic nervous system occurs by slowing down the breathing and releasing tension you are holding (especially in the face, jaw and shoulders). Your natural relaxation reaction to the body is a confirmation to your nervous system that you are safe, and you can sink deeper into the present moment.

### **The Science of Inner Stillness**

Evidence of positive psychology research proves that appreciating things, even in small aspects, consciously remodels the brain. This habit makes your mind stop thinking about what you lack and think about what you have.

This meditation teaches you to identify with your nameless, shapeless, beautiful side of yourself- the essence of immortal love and reality. This concern with inner being results in:

*   **Deeper Relaxation:** Relaxing away muscles that you are not using (such as the eyebrows that are so tense or the jaw that is clenched).
*   **Emotional Resilience:** Developing the sense of appreciation towards the self and the world.
*   **Greater Connection:** The ability to see the mere is-ness of the moment without any labels or judgment.

## 3 Moments When You Need This Gratitude Reset

At times, there is no time to meditate, and it seems like an additional burden. However, it is a practice that should be applied as a means to maneuver through the times that you are the least prepared.

Suppose it is 3 PM, and you are having a divided mind. You have that low, humming kind of tension pitting your chest. This meditation will take ten minutes instead of ten minutes of reaching out to grab a cup of coffee. You are blessing yourself with perfection.

This soundtrack is ideal at transitional stages when you have to purposefully lose the main flow and fall inward.

**Use this practice when you need to:**

*   **Reset the Workday Slump:** When you are feeling overwhelmed, exasperated or have a mental fog, nothing will bring you to your senses like a couple of minutes of presence.
*   **Create a Loving Boundary Before Sleep:** Before going to sleep, release all the mental and bodily tension of your day, particularly of your long-time tightness in your jaw and shoulders, to enter into restful sleep.
*   **Ground Yourself Before a Challenging Event:** When you are going to a meeting or are about to have a difficult talk, ground yourself in your inner calm and undying love, so that you may be responding out of a state of deep peace, rather than out of survival.

## Getting the Most Out of This Session

Pricey equipment is not needed, but pre-preparation of the ground to a profound form of relaxation is essential to reaching that feeling of inner calmness.

The following are the exact preparation instructions to use in the meditation to effortlessly drop into the presence:

### **Preparation Checklist**

1.  **Find a Comfortable Position:** Whichever position is comfortable to you at the moment- sitting or lying down. You should leave it to your body to decide what it requires.
2.  **Use Headphones:** Headphones are strongly suggested in order to hear the instructions and the light music better and have a full experience of being immersed.
3.  **Close Your Eyes Lovingly:** Permit yourself to love yourself, and gently shut your eyes and redirect your consciousness.
4.  **Embrace Softness:** You need to learn to be soft in your belly. Experience the swelling on inhalation and complete discharge on exhalation.
5.  **Release Hidden Tension:** Learn to notice the muscles that you find yourself tightening, without realizing it, your eyebrows, your jaw, your shoulders, and your hands. Give them all up to the pressure of gravity.

Free yourself to become interested in your body's feelings. Nothing compels us, just a very mild corroboration and assent.
