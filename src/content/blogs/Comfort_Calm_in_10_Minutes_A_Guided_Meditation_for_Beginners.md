# All is Well: The 10-Minute Reset Your Nervous System Is Craving

Do you ever feel like you’re constantly running on the emotional equivalent of a high-speed treadmill? Do you always have tight shoulders, a narrow chest and a busy mind with the things you need to do on a particular day?

We've all been there. That sense of constant hurry - the undertones of anxiety and not being able to just relax and breathe in the moment.

The positive thing is that your body already has the understanding of how to communicate safely. It only has to be reminded of it softly and deliberately. **The 10-minute guided meditation audio embedded above will serve as your quick-fix to a reduction in the stress response and the reminder that everything is going well, at this point.**

It takes no experience, merely a few minutes of your life, and the desire to just press play

## Why This Meditation Works: The Science of Safety

When stressed, overloaded or worrying about the future, we tend to switch to short, shallow breaths involving only the upper chest. This causes your nervous system to be informed that you are in an environment that requires you to increase your energy, as the audio explains- a message that is commonly linked to the feeling of insecurity.

This 10-minute session deliberately guides you toward **diaphragmatic breathing** (or "belly breathing"). This intentional shift is profound.

### The Benefits of Intentional Relaxation

The fastest method of activating your *parasympathetic nervous system*, also known as "rest and digest" mode, is through diaphragmatic breathing. You can do this by relaxing your belly and letting it expand deeply and gently and, in effect, inform your body: "I am safe. I can relax."

*   **Reduces Muscle Tension:** The advice to drop the shoulders off your ears will help release tension that has built up as a result of stress.
*   **Cultivates Acceptance:** The practice helps you feel like a non-judgmental observer of what is happening to your breath and helps you be more accepting of whatever you currently experience.
*   **Grounds Awareness:** It involves the physical experiences of what you breathe in and what you can feel touching your body to get your surging mind into the present moment and make you feel like you are “at home in your body.”

## When to Use the "All is Well" Reset

The greatest strength of this 10-minute meditation is its flexibility. It is not too long to fit into a hectic timetable, but it becomes efficient enough to bring about an actual difference in your day.

Imagine it's 3:00 PM. You have just had a hectic meeting, time is running out, and the panic is beginning to get into your head. You can use these few minutes to reset your entire physiological state by drinking another coffee instead of taking it.

This guided audio is perfect for:

*   **The Midday Slump:** It is that feeling of brain fog or the sensation of a massive shift of tension or irritation at work. Identify a quiet space and swing by and spend 10 minutes.
*   **Before Sleep Preparation:** When you are in the habit of doing a recreation of the activities of the day or worrying about what tomorrow has in store, you will need to utilize this practice to give your head the signal that it is relaxed and that time is passing.
*   **During Emotional Transitions:** When you are leaving a high-energy task (such as high-intensity exercise or a hectic commute) behind and going to a low-energy task (such as eating dinner or spending family time).

## Getting the Most Out of This Session

Meditation is not a complicated process, but preparing the ground for success is worth doing to make the most of it. This is a practice that is specifically aimed at inviting your body to relax, and therefore, preparation is essential.

### 3 Simple Preparation Steps

1.  **Find a Comfortable Seat:** This is a guide whereby you are asked to find a comfortable seat. This does not need to be on a cushion; a kind of chair with the feet flat on the floor is all that is required. The key is to feel supported.
2.  **Relax Your Frame:** Purposely tilt your shoulders off your ears and relax your belly, and make it soft and slack. This is a physical position that aids in starting the deep breathing that is relaxation.
3.  **Practice Non-Judgment:** In the course of the practice, your mind will wander. This is normal. The guide helps you to just be reminded to pay attention to the wandering and kindly bring your consciousness to the breathing and what you are listening to. You work your concentration muscle every time you come back.
