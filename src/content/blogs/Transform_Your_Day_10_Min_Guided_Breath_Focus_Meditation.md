# From Stressed to Unstoppable in Just 10 Minutes


What if I told you that the difference between feeling overwhelmed and feeling limitless is just one intentional breath away?

You may be bearing the burden of a thousand to-dos, recreating that embarrassing conversation of last night or be caught up in a circumstance you did not create. Your mind may be telling you that you really have to practice hours, have perfect conditions, or that you have some secret knowledge that you have yet to unravel.

And here lies the fact: You already are all you need.

The guided meditation above was not another relaxation track, as it lasts 10 minutes. It’s an accuracy instrument developed to switch your interior off reactive and on to creative, off of limited and on to boundless.

## What Actually Happens in Those 10 Minutes?

Consider this practice as a tactical procedure of your nervous mechanism and thought patterns.

### The Physical Shift

You will begin with deep abdominal breathing (expanding the belly during the inhalation, and drawing in during the exhalation). It is not only relaxing, but it is clearly biochemistry at work. Every conscious breath will trigger your parasympathetic nervous system to tell your body to loosen its hold on stress hormones such as cortisol.

In a few minutes, you can get your heart rate going down. Your muscles soften. Your mind stops racing.


### The Mental Revolution

At this point, things become interesting.

As your body is relaxing, the guided visualization is propelling you further to the realization that you are not the sum of your situation. Your present thoughts do not even define you. Restricting the beliefs you have been carrying? They're just patterns. What you have managed to think over and over again.

This meditation will teach you to have a clear view of them, ask them some soft questions, and make conscious decisions.

## When Does a 10-Minute Reset Change Everything?

What is so beautiful about this practice is that it can fit in the cracks of your real life. There is no need to spend an hour or wait to have the right moment.

### Morning: Set Your Frequency

Prior to phone checking or plunging into requirements, spend 10 minutes deciding what you are going to be today. Not reactive. Not stressed. Yet down to earth, self-assured, and receptive.

### Midday: Break the Spiral

You understand the experience of 2 pm when you sense that everything is weighing down on you, and all the motivation has gone? That's your cue. Rather than ploughing on with fumes, reset. Return to your breath. Remember your power. Observe the way the afternoon changes.

### Before High-Stakes Moments

Use the difficult conversation ahead? A decision that matters? Stagnant creative project? Do not go about it with anxiety or insecurity. You need to take at least 10 minutes to shift to clarity and confidence.

## How to Make This Work For You

No experience needed. No special equipment. Just you, willing to receive.

### Create Your Space

* Go and sit somewhere where you are not bothered.
* Put out your hands (very little action of receiving) in your lap.
* Wear headphones (where that is possible); this enhances the immersion.

### Let Go of Doing It "Right"

* Close your eyes gently
* Breath--do not breathe deeply--do not break your breath.
* When your mind goes (and it will), merely observe and get back to the direction.
* Be kind to yourself. This is a practice and not perfection.

### Just Listen

That's it. The rest will be led by meditation. It is simply to turn up and leave the transformation to take place.

## The Shift You're About to Experience

Within 10 minutes, you will no longer feel the grip of life; you will feel the possibility of creating your own experience as a conscious being.

As you will recall, stress is optional. That confidence is a choice. That the infinite possibility you have been desiring has lived in you all along, waiting just as you clear the noise and get a clear view of it.

**The question isn't whether you have time for this.**

The question is: Can you spare another day living out of a place of limitation where possibility is only 10 minutes away?

Scroll up. Press play. Transform your state.
**Your most confident, peaceful, powerful self is waiting on the other side of this breath.**
