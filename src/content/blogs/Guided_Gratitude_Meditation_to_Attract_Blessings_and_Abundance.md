# Stop Chasing Good Fortune and Start Receiving It

Do you find yourself in the rat race of "what if" or "not enough"? With our overdrive culture of working hard, it is easy to feel that you are always thinly stretched and preoccupied with issues rather than the awesome potential that surrounds you.

The relentless chatter of your mind and the emotional burden of your stress may fatigue you and cause you to overlook the blessings you already have in your life.

The great news? Breaking that stress cycle can be instant.

The 10-minute guided audio above, **Gratitude for the Blessings Coming Your Way!**, is your shortcut to grounding. It involves deep breathing and intense visualization to enable you to realize the support mechanisms that already exist by your side- and condition your mind to accept the good luck that is about to come to your leader and you.

## The Power of Proactive Gratitude

This session will not simply make you feel relaxed; it is created in a way that it will move your energetic set point to abundance and support. With a combination of particular somatic cues and high-level visualization, you are conditioned to seek the good in any circumstance.

When the voice tells you to belly-drop and drop the shoulders, you are literally telling your nervous system to relax, to feel safe. It has been found that deep, diaphragmatic breathing triggers the **parasympathetic nervous system**, and switches the fight-or-flight to rest-and-digest.

The instructed trip, visiting the sunny field, going along the path, and over the stable bridge, is a strong metaphor. The bridge is the support system in your life, which supports you and keeps you out of harm in the process of transition.

You become grateful for this bridging up, and it makes you even stronger in the opinion that you are safe, supported, and on the way to your individual gift, your treasure. This deliberate value makes your brain ready to be drawn to and see new opportunities.

## When to Cross the Metaphorical Bridge

Life is full of changes, great and minor, and in most cases, they are the areas where stress levels are the highest. Think of a time when you have just gotten some tough feedback at work, or you are struggling to make a tough choice at home. Your head is pounding, and your heart is beating.

This meditation is a passageway that is not risky. It makes you feel that you are being backed up well as you head into the uncharted territory. You are not merely abandoning the stress; you are heading to a concrete payoff that awaits you at the other end.

This is an incredibly productive practice when you are in need of a mental recharge, but here are three occasions when you should make it a non-negotiable element of your day:

*   **Before Major Decisions:** This is the time to enter an atmosphere of "Oneness" and confidence before making a big decision. It removes the fog in the mind in order to know the correct way forward.
*   **During the Mid-Day Slump (2-4 PM):** You used to grab a cup of caffeine or sugar to boost your energy, but now you can spend 10 minutes being supported and re-energized. This interrupts the afternoon stress routine.
*   **When You Feel Undervalued:** In case you are doubting your value or feel that you are not getting what you deserve, this meditation will allow you to take the natural value you are born with (your treasure) and remind yourself that you are worthy of everything good.

## Getting the Most Out of Your Gratitude Session

This meditation is powerful because of the level of immersion in the visualization. These are just a few suggestions that you should follow to improve your experience and gain your blessing:

### Find Your Anchor Point
It starts by putting you in a position that feels best at the moment. Sitting before the office chair or lying down on the bed, make sure that the body is actually supported. Be aware of the contact points between you and the surface under you.

### Optimize Your Environment
Although this is a brief meditation, the silence is important. Use headphones if possible. This will enable you to have all the pictures, listen to the sounds of the field, the stability of the bridge, and the sight of your treasure.

### Focus on the Physical Cues
Be careful to pay attention when you are instructed to allow the air to pass freely and, by doing so, cause your belly to soften and become loose. It is this physical relaxation that is the gateway to the deeper, more open state needed in visualization.

### Claim Your Gift
When you come on the metaphorical "pot of treasure," or the "gift", think where you are going to lay it in your life--Is it on a mantle, or is it deep down in your heart? Ensure that the relationship between what you see and your reality is official.

## Claim Your Blessings Now

You have a right to be supported, grounded, and prepared to have abundance. This is not merely a counting of your current blessings practice, but the actual visualization of the gifts and good fortune that are already coming your way.

When you intentionally act with profound gratitude, you cease to be in a state of scarcity but rather an abundance state, and possess the treasure that is yours.
