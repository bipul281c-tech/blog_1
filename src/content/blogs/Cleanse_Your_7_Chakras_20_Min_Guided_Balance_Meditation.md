# Feeling Off? Here's Your 20-Minute Energy Reset

You know that feeling when everything just feels... wrong?

Your brain's foggy. Your body's tired. You can't focus. It's like someone scrambled all of your internal settings, and you are only stumbling through the day on autopilot.

Yeah, we've all been there.

The contemporary lifestyle tends to draw us in all directions simultaneously, work, family, constant notifications, etc., until we are entirely exhausted and have no idea who we are anymore.

Good news: You can fix this. Today. Right now.

Above, there is a 20 Minute Chakra Balance & Cleansing Guided Meditation. And within a few minutes, I shall demonstrate to you how it can make you feel like yourself again.

## What Makes This Meditation Actually Work

Let's make it simple: this is not magic or woo-woo stuff. It is an attention practice that enhances your body and mind to communicate.

Visualize your chakras (energy centers) as the applications in your phone. When too many are running simultaneously or the glitching in something, everything slows down. This meditation is nothing more than a reboot button to your whole system.

The following is what happens on press play:

The guide will take you through every energy center in your body, beginning with your feet and working up to the top of your head. When you take long, deep breaths and see certain colors, for example, the red at the bottom or the green at the heart, you are doing something very serious: you are telling your nervous system that it is time to relax.

When you are breathing deeply, your body goes into a natural mode of calming down. The concentrated image allows us to unwind the energy that has been stagnant due to stress, anxiety and the overall messiness of everyday existence.

The result? You are refreshed, unswayed, and rejuvenated. And to strike the refresh button on your whole soul.

## When Should You Actually Use This?

Imagine theism: it is Wednesday, 2 PM. You have been staring at the computer screen all the time, your shoulders are up by your ears and you cannot remember the last coherent thought you had. Sound familiar?

You might spend the next 20 minutes restarting your entire system instead of getting the fourth cup of coffee or wasting time on social media.

Here's when this meditation is a game-changer:

* **Before something important:** Do you have a big presentation? Tough conversation ahead? This session assists you in presenting yourself in a confident and centered manner rather than anxious and disoriented.

* **When the afternoon crash hits:** That 3 pm brain fog? This meditation is like defogging with caffeine, and you will not be awake at night.

* **Before bed:** Trouble sleeping? This will make you shed all the emotional baggage of the day, so that you can actually sleep, rather than continue to re-enact all the awkward moments of the previous week.

* **When you feel emotionally overwhelmed:** There are times when life is simply a lot. This provides you with a systematic organization of processing and expelling what you are carrying.

## How to Get the Best Results

The beautiful thing about this meditation? You do not have to be good meditators. You do not even need to know about chakras. And you just have to go there and listen.

The manual adds it all: "Trust and know that the energy is working on your behalf. Translation: quit struggling so much and simply allow it to evolve.

### Quick Setup (Takes 2 Minutes)

* **Make yourself at home:** The position will be any way that feels good to your body at the moment. No yoga poses required.

* **Block out the world:** Headphones make your friends. Switch on Do Not Disturb on your phone. These 20 minutes are yours.

* **Take one deep breath:** Before you press play, just get yourself ready and say:- I am permitting myself to reset.

* **Stop overthinking:** The mind will be wandering. That's totally normal. When it does, simply get back to the voice of the guide. There's no test at the end. You can't fail at this.

## Your Energy is Asking for Attention

Consider the amount of time you spend keeping everything else in your life. You have your phone charged, you change the oil, you water your plants.

But when did you last engage in proper maintenance of yourself? Not ransacking on the couch (we are all too familiar that does not in any way make us refreshed), but true, deliberate rest and renewal?

Twenty minutes. That's less time than one episode of your favorite show.

You will be able to reconnect the grounded stable energy at your core in those 20 minutes. You will reach your creativity and inner strength. You will recall how it is to breathe, without having your chest feel tight.

You will feel that you are yourself.
